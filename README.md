## DegenToken

DagenToken contract (ERC20 contract) transcations.

## Description

DegenToken is an Ethereum token that adheres to the ERC-20 standard, offering functionalities for minting, burning, and redeeming tokens, specifically designed for certain actions. This project is an excellent starting point for those interested in Ethereum token development or in creating custom tokens with unique features.

By reviewing the source code, you can understand the token contract's structure and tailor it to your specific needs. This project serves both educational purposes and as a foundation for more advanced token development. Additionally, it can be seamlessly integrated into decentralized applications (DApps) to enhance their functionality.

## Installation

1)To download the project, clone the repository:
 https://github.com/Metacrafters/DegenToken

2)Modify in the DegenToken.sol file
    
## Usage

1)Deploy the contract to the Ethereum network using Remix or another Solidity compiler. Make sure to set the name and symbol for your token.

2)Once the contract is deployed, call the mint function to create new tokens and assign them to an address. This function can only be called by the contract owner.

3)Use the transfer function to send tokens from one address to another.
